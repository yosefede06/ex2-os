All questions are worth an equal amount of points.
1. Siglongjmp and sigsetjmp:
    a. Describe what the functions sigsetjmp and siglongjmp do.
    b. Describe how sigsetjmp and siglongjmp affect masking.
2. Describe one general use of user-level threads and explain why user-level threads are a
reasonable choice for your example.
3. Google’s Chrome browser creates a new process for each tab. What are the advantages
and disadvantages of creating the new process (instead of creating a kernel-level
thread)?
4. Interrupts and signals:
a. Open an application (for example, “Shotwell” on one of the CS computers). Use
the “ps -A” command to extract the application’s pid (process ID).
b. Open a shell and type “kill pid”.
c. Explain which interrupts and signals are involved during the command execution,
what triggered them and who should handle them. In your answer, refer to the
keyboard, OS, shell, and the application you just killed
5. What is the difference between ‘real’ and ‘virtual’ time? Give one example of using each.
